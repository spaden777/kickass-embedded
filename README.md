# Kickass Embedded

This repo gives context for my embedded systems work — most of which lives in private repositories due to IP and product constraints.

## 🛠️ Focus Areas

- STM32 firmware (board bring-up, clock tuning, low-power design)
- Real-time systems (bare-metal and FreeRTOS-style schedulers)
- Peripheral integration (I2C, SPI, UART, GPIO, ADC)
- Telemetry and fault pipelines (AWS CLI, JSON structures, OTA logging)
- CI/CD tooling (GitLab, YAML pipelines, build/test automation)

## 📁 What’s in This Repo

- `README.md` – What you’re reading now
- `ci-sample.yml` – An example GitLab CI pipeline (sanitized)
- `telemetry-format.json` – A sample device telemetry payload structure
- `firmware-notes.md` – Example documentation notes I’d hand to a junior dev
